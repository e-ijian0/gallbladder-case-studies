# Case Study: Xanthogranulomatous Cholecystitis (XGC)

## **Patient Presentation**
- **Age/Sex:** 52-year-old female
- **Chief Complaint:** Right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain for 3 weeks, fever, and nausea.
- **Vital Signs:** Temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 102 bpm, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, respiratory rate 18/min.
- **Physical Exam:** Tenderness in the RUQ with positive Murphy's sign. No palpable mass. Mild jaundice (scleral icterus noted).

## **Clinical History**
- **Past Medical History:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
- **Medications:** Metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin.
- **Surgical History:** Appendectomy at age 20.
- **Social History:** Non-smoker, occasional alcohol consumption (1–2 drinks/week).
- **Family History:** Mother with cholelithiasis.

## **Imaging Findings**
### **Ultrasound (RUQ)**
- Gallbladder wall markedly thickened (10 mm) with a layered appearance: hypoechoic inner layer and hyperechoic outer layer.
- Multiple gallstones, one impacted in the neck of the gallbladder.
- Pericholecystic fluid noted.
- No sonographic Murphy's sign (patient unable to localize pain due to diffuse tenderness).
- **Key Differentiating Feature:** Intramural hypoechoic nodules within the thickened wall, representing xanthogranulomas. This is distinct from the homogeneous wall thickening seen in acute cholecystitis and the irregular, mass-like thickening of gallbladder carcinoma.

### **Contrast‑Enhanced CT Abdomen**
- Diffuse, transmural gallbladder wall thickening with **intramural hypoattenuating nodules** (low‑density areas within the wall), characteristic of XGC.
- **“Hal‑o sign”** – a band of low attenuation surrounding the gallbladder wall, representing edema and inflammatory infiltration.
- Mild pericholecystic fat stranding.
- No evidence of local invasion into the liver or regional lymphadenopathy to suggest carcinoma.
- **Differentiation from Acute Cholecystitis:** Acute cholecystitis typically shows homogeneous wall enhancement without intramural low‑density nodules.
- **Differentiation from Gallbladder Carcinoma:** Carcinoma often presents as a focal, irregular, enhancing mass that invades adjacent liver; XGC maintains the gallbladder shape and shows intramural hypoattenuating areas.

## **Laboratory Findings**
- **Complete Blood Count:** WBC 14.5 × 10³/µL (neutrophilia), hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, platelets 350 × 10³/µL.
- **Liver Function Tests:** Total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL (direct 1.8 mg/dL), ALT 85 U/L, AST 78 U/L, ALP 220 U/L.
- **Inflammatory Markers:** CRP 45 mg/L, ESR 65 mm/hr.
- **Blood Cultures:** No growth at 48 hours.

## **Differential Diagnosis**
1. **Xanthogranulomatous Cholecystitis** – most likely given imaging findings of intramural hypoattenuating nodules and layered wall thickening.
2. **Acute Calculous Cholecystitis** – common presentation with RUQ pain, fever, and gallstones, but lacks the intramural nodules.
3. **Gallbladder Adenocarcinoma** – must be ruled out because XGC can mimic carcinoma; however, absence of a discrete mass, liver invasion, or lymphadenopathy favors XGC.
4. **Chronic Cholecystitis** – persistent inflammation without acute features, but intramural nodules are not typical.
5. **Gallbladder Polyps or Adenomyomatosis** – can cause wall thickening but usually focal and without inflammatory signs.

## **Pathology**
### **Gross Description (Cholecystectomy Specimen)**
- Gallbladder measuring 8.5 × 4.0 × 3.5 cm.
- Wall thickened up to 1.2 cm, yellow‑tan nodules scattered throughout the wall.
- Lumen contains multiple mixed cholesterol‑pigment stones, largest 1.8 cm.
- No obvious mucosal ulceration or mass.

### **Microscopic Description**
- Transmural infiltration by foamy histiocytes (xanthoma cells), lymphocytes, plasma cells, and occasional multinucleated giant cells.
- Focal rupture of Rokitansky‑Aschoff sinuses with extravasation of bile and mucin into the wall.
- Areas of hemorrhage and fibrosis.
- No evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

### **Immunohistochemistry**
- CD68 positive (histiocytic marker).
- Cytokeratin negative in xanthoma cells (helps exclude carcinoma).

**Final Histopathologic Diagnosis:** Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis.

## **Management**
- **Initial Management:** Intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin‑tazobactam) and fluid resuscitation. Pain controlled with IV acetaminophen and ketorolac.
- **Definitive Treatment:** Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed on hospital day 3. Due to dense adhesions and inflammatory changes, conversion to open cholecystectomy was necessary.
- **Intraoperative Findings:** Gallbladder densely adherent to the liver bed and omentum; careful dissection preserved the common bile duct.
- **Post‑operative Course:** Patient recovered well, discharged on post‑operative day 5 with oral antibiotics for 7 days.
- **Follow‑up:** Outpatient clinic at 2 weeks; liver function tests normalized, and patient asymptomatic.

## **Discussion**
Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare, aggressive form of chronic cholecystitis characterized by a destructive inflammatory process that can mimic gallbladder carcinoma both clinically and radiologically.

### **Pathophysiological Mechanism**
The condition is thought to arise from long‑standing obstruction (often by a gallstone) leading to increased intraluminal pressure, rupture of Rokitansky‑Aschoff sinuses, and extravasation of bile and mucin into the gallbladder wall. This triggers a vigorous inflammatory response with accumulation of lipid‑laden macrophages (xanthoma cells), hemorrhage, and fibrosis—the hallmark xanthogranulomatous reaction.

### **Key Imaging Clues**
- **Ultrasound:** Layered wall thickening with intramural hypoechoic nodules.
- **CT:** Transmural thickening with intramural hypoattenuating nodules and the “hal‑o sign” of pericholecystic edema.
- **MRI:** T2‑hyperintense nodules within the wall; diffusion‑weighted imaging can help differentiate from malignancy (XGC tends to have lower ADC values due to cellular infiltrate, but overlap exists).

### **Why It Matters**
1. **Pre‑operative Diagnosis:** Recognizing XGC can prevent unnecessary extended resections (e.g., hepatic resection) that might be performed for suspected carcinoma.
2. **Surgical Planning:** Anticipate dense adhesions and consider possible conversion to open surgery.
3. **Prognosis:** XGC carries a higher risk of post‑operative complications (bile leak, infection) but does not carry the malignant potential of carcinoma.

### **Teaching Points**
- Always include XGC in the differential diagnosis of a thickened gallbladder wall, especially when intramural low‑density nodules are present.
- Correlation with clinical presentation (subacute symptoms, fever, elevated inflammatory markers) supports the diagnosis.
- Histopathology remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.
